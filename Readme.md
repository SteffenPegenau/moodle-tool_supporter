## About
With the Supporter you can simply find & manage your students and courses - all in one, intuitve windows.

It is the successor to the [Moodle Analyst](https://moodle.org/plugins/report_moodleanalyst) which was also created at the TU Darmstadt.

The Supporter is developed with amd and thus only retrieves the information from the database which are needed, not requiring reloading of the whole page; bringing a whole new user experience to moodle users.

It has built-in the standard Moodle Capability-Checks so there are no extra capabilites needed and multiple levels of Support can be accomplished.

## Installation
* Copy/Clone to https://YOURSITE/admin/tool/ directory
* Enable database upgrade under https://YOURSITE/admin/
* Go to https://YOURSITE/admin/tool/supporter
